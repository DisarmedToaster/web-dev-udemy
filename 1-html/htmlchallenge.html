        <p>
          Well, you can! And I'm here to show you where and how!
        </p>

        <h2>The "how"</h2>
        <p>
          There are many ways to acheive your goal of becoming
          a web developer. The sky is the limit! 
        </p>

        <p>
          Everyone is different and has different learning preferences.
          Here are just a few types of resources available
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Books / E-Books</li>
          <li>Online tutorials</li>
          <li>Instructional videos</li>
          <li>Schools / Bootcamps</li>
        </ul>

      <div>

        <h2>The "where"</h2>

        <h3>Books</h3>
        <p>
          There are tons of books out there. So which do you choose?
          Take a look on <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="blank">Amazon.</a>
          Find a book with tons of great reviews. 
        </p>

        <h3>Online Tutorials</h3>
        <p>
          There are lots of great online tutorials, from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="blank">The Odin Project</a>
          to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="blank">W3 Schools.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          My personal favorite, however, is a course conducted by Rob Percival
          at <a href="https://www.udemy.com" target="blank">Udemy.com</a>, called
          <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-course-2/" target="blank">"The Complete Web Developer Course".</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Instructional Videos</h3>
        <p>
          There are tons of instructional videos out there.
          I would suggest going to <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="blank">Youtube.com</a> 
          and searching for "learn web development". Here is just one example of a great instructional video.

        </p>

        <h3>Schools / Bootcamps</h3>
        <p>
          If you can afford university, and would like to go that route, of course you probably should.
          You don't necessarily need a degree to work in web development, but it does make it a bit 
          easier to get an interview!
        </p>
        <p>
          As for boot camps; they can be very expensive and not all are created equal. Make double sure
          that this is what you want to do and find THE BEST ONE. Typically, you should have at least
          a basic understanding, however, before attending one of these. They are very intensive, move quite fast,
          and it can be difficult to keep up.
        </p>

        <p>
          All in all, there are tons of options out there. The main thing is that you find your thing and stick with it.
          No one ever succeeded without lots of hard work and dedication.
